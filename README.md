## Overview

### The challenge

It is the first practice that you did in a fluent way. If there were some things that I had to find out on the Internet how to position the images well with the backgrounds, how to put the top corners of the hero image. But there are many things that are difficult for me, such as making it responsive.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned some new css properties to get the two corners to the hero image

```css
.card .card_img {
    width: 100%;
    border-start-start-radius: 22px;
    border-start-end-radius: 22px;
    align-self: center;
}
```
### Continued development

I will do more practices to perfect my work and the code.
